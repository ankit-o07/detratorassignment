# Responsive UI with Material-UI

This project is a responsive user interface built with Material-UI. It includes dynamic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes using Material-UI's sx prop with media queries. It does not use any CSS, SCSS, or React.

## Features

### Header Section
- **Brand Name**: Displays the brand name prominently on all screens.
- **Search Bar**: Visible on larger screens, hidden on screens smaller than 600px.
- **User Section**: Includes an avatar and a name. On smaller screens, the name is hidden, but the avatar remains visible.



## Technology Stack
- **Next js**: For building the user interface.
- **Material-UI**: For styling and responsive design.
